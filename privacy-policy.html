            <h2>Privacy Policy for Clip Keeper</h2>
            <p><em>Last updated: April 11, 2024</em></p>
            
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Clip Keeper ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application Clip Keeper (the "App").</p>
            
            <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
            
            <h4>Clipboard Data</h4>
            <p>Clip Keeper is designed to save and manage content from your device's clipboard. The App accesses and stores text and images that you copy to your clipboard. This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</p>
            
            <h4>Usage Data</h4>
            <p>We may collect anonymous usage statistics to help us improve the App. This includes information about how you interact with the App, such as which features you use most frequently. This data is collected in a way that does not personally identify you.</p>
            
            <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>

                <li>Detect and address technical issues</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Data Storage and Security</h3>
            <p>All clipboard data is stored locally on your device. We do not upload or store your clipboard data on any servers. Your data remains on your device unless you explicitly choose to share it using the App's sharing features.</p>
            
            <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>The App may use third-party services such as Google Play Services. These services may collect information used to identify you. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these third parties to understand how they handle your data.</p>
            
            <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>
